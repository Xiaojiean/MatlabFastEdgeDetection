# MatlabFastEdgeDetection
Fast Detection of Faint Curved Edges in Noisy Images

- Set up c++ compiler for Matlab
- Compile the code on your machine with compile.m
- Run demo.m
- Try the code on your image

Notes:
- Work only on 64bit machine, for 32bit machine, replace opencv libraries.
- Work only on squared images, a new version that works on any image size will be published soon.

Good Luck!
