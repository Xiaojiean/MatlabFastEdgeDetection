# MatlabFastEdgeDetection
Fast Detection of Faint Curved Edges in Noisy Images

1) Set up c++ compiler for Matlab
2) Compile the code on your machine with compile.m
3) Run demo.m
4) Try the code on your image

Notes:
- Work only on 64bit machine, for 32bit machine, replace open libraries.
- Work only on squared images, a new version that works on any image size will be published soon

Good Luck!
